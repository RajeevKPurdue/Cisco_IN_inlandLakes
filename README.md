Processing, Summarization, Interpolation, and Visualization of inland lake oxythermal/water quality data and cold-water fish habitat.
1- Process MiniDOT ".TXT OR .CSV" files 
2- Arrange, Summarize, and Interpolate Temperature and Dissolved Oxygen- Time Series for water column
3- Apply GRP model variations and generate output arrays
4- Extract time periods of interest, perform additional processing and habitat analyses
4- Create DataFrames to compare model variations
5- Visualize Arrays and DataFrames
6- Sensitivity/ Model Performance of GRP model variations with synthetic data
